## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
This project helped me refreshed on how to make API calls, and using grids.

I also learned how "one click copy to clipboard" works using JavaScript.

### Continued development

There are still a few minor issues with the current styling. I will attempt fixing them in the future.

In future projects, I may move onto using a library for CSS for consistency.
